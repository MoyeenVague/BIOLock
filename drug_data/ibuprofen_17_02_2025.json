    "methods": "A retrospective review of pediatric patients <18 ys of age who underwent LC from 2016 to 2022 was performed. Patients who underwent open cholecystectomy or additional surgical procedures performed simultaneously were excluded. Patient demographics, operative details, medication usage, and postoperative complications were recorded. Patients prescribed opioid pain medication at discharge were compared to those who were treated with nonopioid pain medications (i.e., acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and ketorolac).",
    "results": "In total, 511 patients were included, of which 76.9% were prescribed opioids. Patients who were not prescribed opioids more commonly received intravenous ketorolac (81.4% versus 35.6%, P < 0.001), used less postoperative morphine milligram equivalents per kilogram (MME) (0.3 versus 0.4 MME/kg, P = 0.044), had lower rates of postoperative phone calls for pain (6.8% versus 18.8%, P = 0.002), and reported less pain at follow-up (6.8% versus 18.8%, P = 0.002). There were no differences in emergency department visits or hospital readmissions within 30 ds of discharge. Institutional rates of opioid prescriptions following LC decreased over the study duration (97.8% in 2016 to 28.4% in 2022, P < 0.001).",

In the CIA model, CLHE significantly reduced paw swelling, arthritic scoring, C-reactive protein levels, and spleen indices, outperforming ibuprofen. Expression analysis confirmed the downregulation of COX-2, TNFα, and MMP-9. Histopathological analysis indicated the superior efficacy of CLHE compared to ibuprofen in reducing inflammation, synovial hyperplasia, and bone erosion. Computational studies identified compound-15 (CL15), (4-(4,7-dimethoxy-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-oxo pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid), a non-toxic compound with strong binding affinities to COX-2 (-12.9 KJ/mol), and TNF-α (-5.8 KJ/mol).",
