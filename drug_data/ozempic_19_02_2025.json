The proportion of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation was higher with semaglutide versus placebo (16.6% vs. 8.2%; p < 0.001), a difference driven by gastrointestinal disorders (10.0% vs. 2.0%); however, proportions due to SAEs leading to discontinuation were similar (3.6% vs. 4.1%). Suicide/self-injury SAEs were low and balanced between groups (0.11% in both groups). Gallbladder-related disorders were more frequent with semaglutide versus placebo (2.8% vs. 2.3%; p = 0.04), mainly driven by cholelithiasis (1.4% vs. 1.1%), whereas proportions of cholecystitis were similar between groups (0.6% vs. 0.6%).",

The network meta-analysis demonstrated low heterogeneity, ensuring the reliability of the results. Comprehensive analysis revealed the following: Efpeglenatide was the most effective in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events. Oral semaglutide shows more significant advantages in reducing all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Orforglipron excelled in glycaemic control and weight reduction. SC-Semaglutide showed the greatest efficacy in lowering both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, Liraglutide showed the greatest efficacy in lowering total cholesterol, Noiiglutide in triglycerides and Taspoglutide in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but no GLP-1RAs in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. GLP-1RAs did not significantly increase the incidence of adverse events, but Orforglipron and Taspoglutide significantly increased the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events compared with placebo.",
